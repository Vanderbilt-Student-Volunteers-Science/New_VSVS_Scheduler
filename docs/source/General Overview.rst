General Overview
=======================
VSVS teaches interactive, hands-on science lessons to students in 5th-8th grade classrooms from the Metro Nashville
Public School System. Our volunteers get assigned to a classroom, where they teach at the same time each week for 4
consecutive weeks. All lessons are Monday - Thursday, with the earliest ones starting at 7:45 AM and the latest
lessons ending around 5:00 PM.
Each VSVS team of volunteers has 2-3 students in addition to a team leader. The goal of our Python script is to assign
volunteers to classrooms with a lesson time that fits into their schedule.

Applications
------------
VSVS has 3 different types of applications for people who want to be involved.

**Teacher Applications:**

This application is for teachers who would liked to have VSVS teams visit their classrooms to teach lessons. We collect
the following information:

   - 

**Volunteer Applications:**

Another application is for Vanderbilt student (both undergraduate and graduate) volunteers
who want to teach lessons. We collect the following information in the application:

   - Name
   - Email
   - Phone number
   - Robotics interest -- Would they be interested in teaching after-school robotics lessons?
   - Availability (schedule of commitments)
   - Interest in being a team leader

**Partner Applications:**

The final application, the partner application, allows volunteers to indicate preferences if they would like to be in a
team with specific people. We collect the following information in the application:

   - Number of Partners
   - Group Member emails

**ONE PERSON** from the group needs to fill out a partner application. And **EVERYONE** needs to submit their own
individual application. For instance, if 3 friends decide they want to be in the same group, VSVS should receive 3
individual applications and 1 partner application.
