General Overview
=======================
VSVS teaches interactive, hands-on science lessons to students in 5th-8th grade classrooms from the Metro Nashville
Public School System. Our volunteers get assigned to a classroom, where they teach lessons for 4 consecutive weeks. All
lessons are Monday - Thursday, with the earliest ones starting at 8:00 AM and the latest lessons ending around 3:45 PM.
Each VSVS team of volunteers has 2-3 students in addition to a team leader. The goal of our Python script is to assign
volunteers to classrooms with a lesson time that fits into their schedule.
